After completing the review, you MUST end your response with an explicit status marker.

Rules:
- If there are no blocking issues: output `[STATUS: success]`.
- If there are blocking issues: output `[STATUS: fail]` and include `[FAILURE_REASON: ...]` with a concise summary.
- Always include exactly one status marker.
